Build the powerful CNN image classification model on predicting the classic large image dataset Food 101. The Food 101 totally contains 101,000 images for 101 labels, which is 1,000 images for each label. 

The model is built on with the empowerment from using feature extraction and and then the fine-tuning of the EfficientNet B0. 

The model reaches the overall 71.24% accuracy rate on the test set.

The whole training is completed on the Google Colab. 

### Update:
Build the model with the more complex EfficientNet B3, which the choice is based on consideration of resources used. The model reaches the 81.29% accuracy rate on the test set.
